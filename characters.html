        Bob loves burgers!
        <p>
            Bob is tuned to a calmer frequency than the 
            rest of his family, and often plays the 'straight man'
            (although he is semi-canonically bi) ba-dum-tsh!
            Still, although on the surface the most generic
            of white men, he's actually a pretty quirky guy.
            He adores gardening, he talks to inanimate objects, and he takes
            his cooking very seriously.
            To Bob, making burgers is an art. He is constantly
            trying to come up with the next best recipe with the
            punniest name. This love for creativity is what drove
            him to leave his father's more traditional burger business,
            Big Bob's Diner, and create the titular Bob's Burgers restaurant.

        Linda loves singing!
        <p>
           Linda is Bob's total opposite in that she is extremely
           extroverted, excitable and energetic. She is constantly singing -
           it's off key but it's very heartfelt. Linda has a big heart, and 
           she cares a lot for her husband and family. One of Linda's strengths is 
           that she's very supportive of her family, especially her kids, sometimes
           to the point of insanity. For example, when her kids tell 
           her they're going to go poke a dead oppossum, she hypes them up
           instead of saying ----uhhhhh noooo!!!! Although Linda seems content
           to work in the restaurant and be a mom, her dreams often go back 
           to the stage - for example, her high school band, the Tatas, and her
           dream of being a cheerleader that comes back when Gene joins his school's 
           team. She uses this flair for the dramatic to bring joy and pizazz
           into every corner of the Belcher household and restaurant.

        Tina loves writing erotic friend fiction.
        <p>
            Tina is a sweet yet awkward and uncomfortably hormonal teenager. She's 
            the oldest sibling, and she feels her responsibilities strongly.
            As well as being the go to babysitter for the family (that never goes well) 
            Tina is a rule follower and a proud hall-monitor for her school.
            She's the voice of (sort of) reason among her siblings.
            Her kryptonite? Boys and butts, especially the forbidden behind
            of Jimmy Junior, the son of Bob's rival restauranteur, Jimmy Pesto.
            Sometimes she writes "erotic friend fiction," aka fan fiction
            about her friend group, involving lots of butt focused
            scenarios. It's all g (or pg), but it is a bit strange.
             She also loves horses.

        Gene loves music!
        <p>
          Gene is full of energy as the off-the-walls middle child.
          He's constantly coming up with songs and dances that he accompanies with his keyboard,
          which he plays in a self-taught way. He also seems to have some kind
          of fascination with bodily fluids and the like. He's a sweetie, but honestly
          to me he is the most annoying character because he is yelling most of the time.
          Not in an angry way, he just gets very excited. Although he's an unpredictable 
          wheel of chaos, and he did take a bath in baked beans once,
           he is in some ways the friendly glue that keeps rule following
          Tina and incorrigible Louise together. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box2" style="flex-grow:1;">
        Louise loves chaos.
<p>
    Louise is a hardened criminal inside a nine year old's body. She has
    absolutely zero scruples...or at least that's her persona. When it comes
    down to it, she does have a heart - but if anyone is ready at a moment's notice
    to set a building on fire or to rob a bank it's her. Although she's the youngest,
    she's the mastermind of the family. She's the one getting the kids into trouble,
    but also the one getting them out of it. A point of vulnerability for Louise
    (but also another aspect of her typical defiance against social convention) is the pink bunny hat that 
    she wears at all times. When Logan, a teenage bully, takes her hat in one episode,
    the camera never shows the top of her head until she is wearing a bag over it, I assume 
    out of respect, as well as to continue the mystery that is the top of her head.
