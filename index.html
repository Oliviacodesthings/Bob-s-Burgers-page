    <p> Welcome to my Bob's Burgers fan page! </p> 
    
    <p>Bob's Burgers is my current comfort show. It's totally surreal and crazy,
        and all the characters are kind of deranged. The reason I was curious
    to watch it was because I read that it's a unique show in that most of the 
conflicts come from outside the family, not the family hating on each other. They all
love each other and work together even though they're "flawed weirdos" as oysters-aint-for-me
says. I think that's part of why I like it so much. The idea that you can be totally cringey
and offputting and terrible at singing and your people will still love you. ...And I like that
it's so unhinged you often can't predict where it is going. </p>
